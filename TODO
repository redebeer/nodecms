implement better file upload from jqueryupload folder

generate data graph with range from date input

finalize script that disects log files and stores into mysql -> or find effective alternative method

!-- very important: mikrotik web proxy is not forwarding client ip to apache, apache only records webproxy ip, request for graph to be populated with data used per user is hence not possible, 
        will have to find alternative->mikrotik will not implement client ip fwding

create script to manage this website's "file upload" file(s), seed table, xfer and notify client

find effective way to retreive wifi stats of node -> eg netflow

link  cpu graph values to that of actual cpu and do same for other graphs-> currently using random values for display purposes

create table view of last few entires making up graphs to be displayed below graphs


move individual mysql selects to post login and store data in session - or find a better way to handle data
